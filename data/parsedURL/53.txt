51-FORTH - Wikipedia 51-FORTH From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search 51-FORTH Original author(s) Scott Gehmlich[1] Initial release 1989; 31 years ago (1989) Written in assembly language Type Forth programming language License public domain 51-FORTH is an implementation of the Forth programming language for the Intel 8051 microcontroller. It was created in 1989 by Scott Gehmlich of IDACOM Electronics (which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 1990), and sent to Giovanni Moretti of Massey University, from whom it was propagated widely.[1] The original 51forth.zip package is available from many archive sites, along with several other implementations of Forth. This implementation is subroutine-threaded, with about 20 words written in assembly language, and the complete system occupying a total of about 8K of RAM. It was cross-developed from a VAX to an RTX2000 Forth system connected to dual-ported RAM accessible to the microcontroller.
