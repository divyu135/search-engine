ASP.NET - Wikipedia ASP.NET From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search server-side open-source web application framework Not to be confused with UNESCO ASPNet. ASP.NET (software) Developer(s) Microsoft Initial release January 5, 2002; 18 years ago (2002-01-05) Stable release 4.8 / April 18, 2019; 19 months ago (2019-04-18)[1] Written in .NET languages Operating system Microsoft Windows, Linux, macOS Platform Cross-platform Type Web framework License Apache License 2.0 Website dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet ASP.NET (file format) Filename extension .aspx, .cshtml, .vbhtml Internet media type text/html Developed by Microsoft ASP.NET is an open-source,[2] server-side web-application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, applications and services. It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology. ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language. The ASP.NET SOAP extension framework allows ASP.NET components to process SOAP messages. ASP.NET's successor is ASP.NET Core. It is a re-implementation of ASP.NET as a modular web framework, together with other frameworks like Entity Framework. The new framework uses the new open-source .NET Compiler Platform (codename "Roslyn") and is cross platform. ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Web Pages (a platform using only Razor pages) have merged into a unified MVC 6.[3] Contents 1 Programming models 2 IIS integrated pipeline 3 Third-party frameworks 4 Versions 5 Other implementations 6 References 6.1 Citations 6.2 Sources 7 External links Programming models[edit] ASP.NET supports a number of programming models for building web applications:[4] ASP.NET Web Forms – A framework for building modular pages out of components, with UI events being processed server-side. ASP.NET MVC – allows for building web pages using the model–view–controller design pattern. ASP.NET Web Pages – A lightweight syntax for adding dynamic code and data access directly inside HTML markup.[5] ASP.NET Web API – A framework for building Web APIs on top of the .NET Framework.[6] ASP.NET WebHooks – Implements the Webhook pattern for subscribing to and publishing events via HTTP. SignalR – A real-time communications framework for bi-directional communication between client and server. Other ASP.NET extensions include: ASP.NET Handler – Components that implement the System.Web.IHttpHandler interface. Unlike ASP.NET Pages, they have no HTML-markup file, no events and other supporting. All they have is a code-file (written in any .NET-compatible language) that writes some data to the server HTTP response. HTTP handlers are similar to ISAPI extensions. ASP.NET AJAX – An extension with both client-side as well as server-side components for writing ASP.NET pages that incorporate Ajax functionality. ASP.NET Dynamic Data – A scaffolding extension to build data driven web applications. IIS integrated pipeline[edit] On IIS 6.0 and lower, pages written using different versions of the ASP framework cannot share session state without the use of third-party libraries. This does not apply to ASP.NET and ASP applications running side by side on IIS 7. With IIS 7.0, modules may be run in an integrated pipeline that allows modules written in any language to be executed for any request.[7] Third-party frameworks[edit] It is not essential to use the standard Web forms development model when developing with ASP.NET. Noteworthy frameworks designed for the platform include: Base One Foundation Component Library (BFC) is RAD framework for building .NET database and distributed computing applications. DotNetNuke is an open-source solution that provides both a web application framework and a content management system that allows for advanced extensibility through modules, skins, and providers. Castle MonoRail, an open-source MVC framework with an execution model similar to Ruby on Rails. The framework is commonly used with Castle ActiveRecord, an ORM layer built on NHibernate. Versions[edit] The ASP.NET releases history tightly correlates with the .NET Framework releases: Date Version Remarks New ASP.NET related features January 16, 2002 Old version, no longer maintained: 1.0 First version released together with Visual Studio .NET Object-oriented Web application development supporting inheritance, polymorphism and other standard OOP features Developers are no longer forced to use Server.CreateObject(...), so early-binding and type safety are possible. Based on Windows programming; the developer can make use of DLL class libraries and other features of the Web server to build more robust applications that do more than simply rendering HTML (e.g., exception handling) April 24, 2003 Old version, no longer maintained: 1.1 released together with Windows Server 2003 released together with Visual Studio .NET 2003 Mobile controls Automatic input validation November 7, 2005 Old version, no longer maintained: 2.0 codename Whidbey released together with Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Web Developer Express and SQL Server 2005 New data controls (GridView, FormView, DetailsView) New technique for declarative data access (SqlDataSource, ObjectDataSource, XmlDataSource controls) Navigation controls Master pages Login controls Themes Skins Web parts Personalization services Full pre-compilation New localization technique Support for 64-bit processors Provider class model November 21, 2006 Old version, no longer maintained: 3.0 Released with Windows Vista Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Windows Communication Foundation, which can use ASP.NET to host services Windows CardSpace, which uses ASP.NET for login roles November 19, 2007 Old version, no longer maintained: 3.5 Released with Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008 New data controls (ListView, DataPager) ASP.NET AJAX included as part of the framework Support for HTTP pipelining and syndication feeds.
