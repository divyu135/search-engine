Also, 28-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. The only significant 28-bit computer was the Norsk Data ND-505, which was essentially a 32-bit machine with four wires in its address bus removed. The reason for scaling down was to be able to sell it to Eastern Bloc countries, avoiding the then CoCom embargo on 32-bit machines. v t e Norsk Data History Benham Park Dietz Computer Systems Dolphin Server Technology FUNN Økernsenteret SAM Tandberg Minicomputers Nord-1 Nord-5 Nord-10 Nord-50 Nord-100 ND-500 ND-5000 Software LED Ndix Notis Nord Programming Language Norsk Data Assembler Nord-TSS Nortext PED PLANC Sibas Sintran Sintran III People Tor Alfheim Per Bjørge Erik Engebretsen Kolbjørn Johansen Lars Monrad-Krohn Rolf Skår This computer science article is a stub.
