Both operating systems are based on the Linux kernel. Chrome OS is designed to work exclusively with web applications. Announced on July 7, 2009, Chrome OS is currently publicly available and was released summer 2011. The Chrome OS source code was released on November 19, 2009, under the BSD license as Chromium OS. Container-Optimized OS (COS) is an operating system that is optimized for running Docker containers, based on Chromium OS.[3] Android is an operating system for mobile devices. It consists of Android Runtime (userland) with Linux (kernel), with its Linux kernel modified to add drivers for mobile device hardware and to remove unused Vanilla Linux drivers. gLinux, a Linux distribution that Google uses internally Fuchsia is a capability-based, real-time, operating system (RTOS) scalable to universal devices, in early development, from the tiniest embedded hardware, wristwatches, tablets to the largest personal computers. Unlike Chrome OS and Android, it is not based on the Linux kernel, but instead began on a new microkernel called "Zircon", derived from "Little Kernel".
