DEC Text Processing Utility - Wikipedia DEC Text Processing Utility From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Text Processing Utility) Jump to navigation Jump to search DEC Text Processing Utility (or DECTPU)[1][2] was a language developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for developing text editors. In 1986, DEC developed a new version of EDT written in TPU, having released EVE, also a TPU-based editor, by mid-1985.[3] TPU is distributed with OpenVMS. It is designed to be used on a terminal or console, so that it is not necessary to have DECwindows installed to use it. Among other things the Language-Sensitive Editor and EVE (Extensible Versatile Editor) are implemented using DECTPU. TPU provides text buffer management APIs in concert with Window management APIs which were targeted for the VT-XXX line of terminals.[citation needed] This allowed split screen windows with scrolling and hence multiple views of the same buffer content.[citation needed] There were also key mapping APIs provided allowing a wide range of functionality over all for editing text.[citation needed] A version of the VI editor was created by Gregg Wonderly at Oklahoma State University called TPUVI and also VITPU by some parties.[citation needed] VITPU is still made available for use via the DECUS archives on line.[citation needed] References[edit] ^ Guide to the DEC Text Processing Utility ^ "DEC Text Processing Utility Reference Manual".
