IBM RISC System/6000 - Wikipedia IBM RISC System/6000 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from RS/6000) Jump to navigation Jump to search 1990s line of RISC servers and workstations from IBM The RISC System/6000 (RS/6000), is a family of RISC-based Unix servers, workstations and supercomputers made by IBM in the 1990s. The RS/6000 family replaced the IBM RT PC computer platform in February 1990 and was the first computer line to see the use of IBM's POWER and PowerPC based microprocessors. In October 2000, the RS/6000 brand was retired for POWER-based servers and replaced by the eServer pSeries. Workstations continued under the RS/6000 brand until 2002, when new POWER-based workstations were released under the IntelliStation POWER brand.

Some later models conformed to the PReP and CHRP standard platforms, which were co-developed with Apple and Motorola, with Open Firmware. The plan was to enable the RS/6000 to run multiple operating systems such as Windows NT, NetWare, OS/2, Solaris, Taligent, AIX and Mac OS but in the end only IBM's Unix variant AIX was used and supported on RS/6000. Linux is widely used on CHRP based RS/6000s, but support was added after the RS/6000 name was changed to eServer pSeries in 2000. The RS/6000 family also included the POWERserver servers, POWERstation workstations and Scalable POWERparallel supercomputer. While most machines were desktops, desksides, or rack-mounted, there was a laptop model too, the Model 860. Famous RS/6000s include the P2SC-based Deep Blue supercomputer that beat world champion Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997, and the POWER3-based ASCI White which was the fastest supercomputer in the world during 2000–2002. Models[edit] Some models were marketed under the RS/6000 POWERstation and POWERserver names.

The internal batteries could power the system for 45 minutes only and an external battery pack that lasted for 4 hours was available for this reason.[5] Type 7008[edit] Model CPU MHz L2/L3 Cache Memory Enclosure Introduced Discontinued Model M20 POWER1 33 None 16 to 64 MB All-in-one 1993-02-02 1995-01-06 Model M2A[6] POWER1 33 None 16 to 64 MB All-in-one 1993-02-02 1994-10-26 These workstations were marketed under the PowerStation name.

The service processor could call a phone number (via a modem) in case of serious failure with the machine.[22] Early advertisements and documentation called the service processor "System Guard",[23] (or SystemGuard[24]) although this name was apparently dropped later on, roughly around the same time that the simplified RS/6000 name was adopted for the computer line itself. Late in the RS/6000 cycle, the service processor was "converged" with the one used on the AS/400 machines.[25] See also[edit] IBM POWER microprocessors IBM AIX IBM Scalable POWERparallel IBM pSeries IBM System p References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j "RS/6000 Machine Type Models".
