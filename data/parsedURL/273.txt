Genie (programming language) - Wikipedia Genie (programming language) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Not to be confused with ALGOL 68 Genie, or Geany. Genie Paradigm multi-paradigm: imperative, structured, object-oriented Designed by Jamie McCracken First appeared 2008; 12 years ago (2008) Stable release 0.38.8 / February 15, 2018; 2 years ago (2018-02-15) Typing discipline static, strong OS Cross-platform (every platform supported by GLib) License LGPLv2.1+ Filename extensions .gs Website wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Genie Influenced by Python, Boo, D, Object Pascal Free and open-source software portal Genie is a modern, general-purpose high-level programming language in development since 2008.[1] It was designed as an alternative, simpler and cleaner dialect for the Vala compiler, while preserving the same functionality of the Vala language. Genie uses the same compiler and libraries as Vala; the two can indeed be used alongside each other.[2] The differences are only syntactic. Genie's syntax is derived from numerous modern languages like Python, Boo, D and Delphi. In the vein of Pascal and Python, Genie uses indentation rather than curly brackets to delimit blocks. Like Vala, Genie uses the GObject type system to create classes and interfaces declared in Genie source code, without imposing additional runtime requirements (i.e., unlike Python, Java or C#, it does not require a virtual machine). Genie allows access to C libraries, especially those based in GObject (like GTK), without using a different application binary interface (ABI). During compilation, the code is first translated to C source and header files, which are then compiled to platform-specific machine code using any available C compiler like GCC, thus allowing cross-platform software development. Programs developed in Vala and Genie don't depend on the GNOME Desktop Environment, usually requiring only GLib.

[indent=4]init    print "Hello, world!" Objects[edit] With no explicit indentation declaration, the default is tabs. class Sample	def run()		stdout.printf("Hello, world! \n ")init	var sample = new Sample()	sample.run() Critique[edit] This article needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2019) As of 2013[update], Genie for loops are inclusive, which makes handling of empty lists cumbersome:[3] var l = new list of stringif l.size > 0    for var i = 0 to (l.size - 1)        print l.@get(i) However, the lists can be iterated using for-in construct easily and straightforward:[4] var l = new list of stringfor s in l:   print s References[edit] ^ Jamie McCracken (2008).
