2B1Q - Wikipedia 2B1Q From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Two-binary, one-quaternary (2B1Q) is a line code used in the U interface of the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Basic Rate Interface (BRI) and the high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (HDSL).[1] 2B1Q is a four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) scheme without redundancy, mapping two bits (2B) into one quaternary symbol (1Q). A competing encoding technique in the ISDN basic rate U interface, mainly used in Europe, is 4B3T. To minimize error propagation, bit pairs (dibits) are assigned to voltage levels according to a Gray code, as follows: Dibit Signal level 10 +450 mV 11 +150 mV 01 −150 mV 00 −450 mV If the voltage is misread as an adjacent level, this causes only a 1-bit error in the decoded data. 2B1Q code is not DC-balanced. Symbol rate is half of data rate. References[edit] ^ Whitham D. Reeve (1995). Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook. IEEE Telecommunications Handbook Series. IEEE Press.
