Contents 1 History 2 SMTP and NNTP 8-bit cleanness 3 See also 4 Notes 5 References History[edit] Up to the early 1990s, many programs and data transmission channels assumed that all characters would be represented as numbers between 0 and 127 (7 bits); for example, the ASCII standard used only 7 bits per character, avoiding an 8-bit representation in order to save on data transmission costs. On computers and data links using 8-bit bytes this left the top bit of each byte free for use as a parity, flag bit, or meta data control bit. 7-bit systems and data links are unable to handle more complex character codes which are commonplace in non-English-speaking countries with larger alphabets. Binary files cannot be transmitted through 7-bit data channels directly. To work around this, binary-to-text encodings have been devised which use only 7-bit ASCII characters. Some of these encodings are uuencoding, Ascii85, SREC, BinHex, kermit and MIME's Base64. EBCDIC-based systems cannot handle all characters used in UUencoded data. However, the base64 encoding does not have this problem. SMTP and NNTP 8-bit cleanness[edit] Historically, various media were used to transfer messages, some of them only supporting 7-bit data, so an 8-bit message had high chances to be garbled during transmission in the 20th century. But some implementations really did not care about formal discouraging of 8-bit data and allowed high bit set bytes to pass through. Such implementations are said to be 8-bit clean. In general, a communications protocol is said to be 8-bit clean if it correctly passes through the high bit of each byte in the communication process.[a] Many early communications protocol standards, such as RFC 780, 788, 821 (for SMTP), RFC 977 (for NNTP), RFC 1056, 2821 and 5321, were designed to work over such "7-bit" communication links. They specifically require the use of ASCII character set "transmitted as an 8-bit byte with the high-order bit cleared to zero" and some of these[1] explicitly restrict all data to 7-bit characters. For the first few decades of email networks (1971 to the early 1990s), most email messages were plain text in the 7-bit US-ASCII character set.[2] According to RFC 1428, the original RFC 821 definition of SMTP limits Internet Mail to lines (1000 characters or less) of 7-bit US-ASCII characters.[3][4][5] Later the format of email messages was re-defined in order to support messages that are not entirely US-ASCII text (text messages in character sets other than US-ASCII, and non-text messages, such as audio and images).[5] RFC 3977[6] specifies "NNTP operates over any reliable bi-directional 8-bit-wide data stream channel." and changes the character set for commands to UTF-8. However, RFC 5536[7] still limits the character set to ASCII, including RFC 2047[8] and RFC 2231[9] MIME encoding of non-ASCII data. The Internet community generally adds features by extension, allowing communication in both directions between upgraded machines and not-yet-upgraded machines, rather than declaring formerly standards-compliant legacy software to be "broken" and insisting that all software worldwide be upgraded to the latest standard. In the mid-1990s, people[who?] objected to "just send 8 bits (to RFC 821 SMTP servers)", perhaps because of a perception that "just send 8 bits" is an implicit declaration that ISO 8859-1 become the new "standard encoding", forcing everyone in the world to use the same character set.[original research?] Instead, the recommended way to take advantage of 8-bit-clean links between machines is to use the ESMTP ( RFC 1869) 8BITMIME extension.[10][11] for message bodies and the SMTP SMTPUTF8[12] extension for message headers. Despite this, some Mail Transfer Agents, notably Exim and qmail, relay mail to servers that do not advertise 8BITMIME without performing the conversion to 7-bit MIME (typically quoted-printable, "Q-P conversion") required by RFC 6152. This "just-send-8" attitude does not in fact cause problems in practice, since virtually all modern email servers are 8-bit clean.[13] See also[edit] 32-bit clean MIME § Content-Transfer-Encoding Telnet § 8-bit data Notes[edit] ^ this is a weaker condition that binary clean.
