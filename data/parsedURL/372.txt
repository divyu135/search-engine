List of IBM products - Wikipedia List of IBM products From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article IBM 526 Printing Summary Punch, ca. 1948, with French keyboard layout The following is a partial list of products, services, and subsidiaries of International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation and its predecessor corporations, beginning in the 1890s. This list is eclectic; it includes, for example, the AN/FSQ-7, which was not a product in the sense of offered for sale, but was a product in the sense of manufactured—produced by the labor of IBM. Several machines manufactured for the Astronomical Computing Bureau at Columbia University are included, as are some machines built only as demonstrations of IBM technology. Missing are RPQs, OEM products (semiconductors, for example), and supplies (punched cards, for example). These products and others are missing simply because no one has added them. IBM sometimes uses the same number for a system and for the principal component of that system. For example, the IBM 604 Calculating Unit is a component of the IBM 604 Calculating Punch. And different IBM divisions used the same model numbers; for example IBM 01 without context clues could be a reference to a keypunch or to IBM's first electric typewriter. Number sequence may not correspond to product development sequence. For example, the 402 tabulator was an improved, modernized, 405.[1] IBM uses two naming structures for its modern hardware products. Products are normally given a three- or four-digit machine type and a model number (it can be a mix of letters and numbers). A product may also have a marketing or brand name. For instance, 2107 is the machine type for the IBM System Storage DS8000. While the majority of products are listed here by machine type, there are instances where only a marketing or brand name is used. Care should be taken when searching for a particular product as sometimes the type and model numbers overlap. For instance the IBM storage product known as the Enterprise Storage Server is machine type 2105, and the IBM printing product known as the IBM Infoprint 2105 is machine type 2705, so searching for an IBM 2105 could result in two different products—or the wrong product—being found. IBM introduced the 80-column rectangular hole punched card in 1928. Pre-1928 machine models that continued in production with the new 80-column card format had the same model number as before. Machines manufactured prior to 1928 were, in some cases, retrofitted with 80-column card readers and/or punches thus there existed machines with pre-1928 dates of manufacture that contain 1928 technology. This list is organized by classifications of both machines and applications, rather than by product name. Thus some (few) entries will be duplicated. The 1420, for example, is listed both as a member of the 1401 family and as a machine for Bank and finance. IBM product names have varied over the years; for example these two texts both reference the same product. Mechanical Key Punch, Type 1 (in Machine Methods of Accounting, IBM, 1936) Mechanical Punch, Type 001 (in IBM Electric Punched Card Accounting Machines: Principles of Operation, IBM, 1946) This article uses the name, or combination of names, most descriptive of the product. Thus the entry for the above is IBM 001: Mechanical Key Punch Products of The Tabulating Machine Company can be identified by date, before 1933 when the subsidiaries were merged into IBM.

Some IBM software products were distributed free (no charge for the software itself, a common practice early in the industry). The term "Program Product" was used by IBM to denote that it's freely available[NB 2] but not for free.[167] Prior to June 1969, the majority of software packages written by IBM were available at no charge to IBM customers; with the June 1969 announcement, new software not designated as "System Control Programming" became Program Products, although existing non-system software remained available for free.[167] Operating systems[edit] AIX, IBM's family of proprietary UNIX OS's (Advanced Interactive eXecutive) on multiple platforms BPS/360 (Basic Programming Support/360) BOS/360 (Basic Operating System/360) TOS/360 (Tape Operating System/360) DM2, Disk Monitor System Version 2 for the IBM 1130 DOS/360 (Disk Operating System/360) DOS/VS (Disk Operating System/Virtual Storage—370), virtual memory successor to DOS/360 DOS/VSE (Virtual Storage Extended—370, 4300) VSE/ESA (Virtual Storage Extended/Enterprise System Architecture) z/VSE for z/Architecture DPCX (Distributed Processing Control eXecutive) for IBM 8100 DPPX (Distributed Processing Programming eXecutive) for IBM 8100 and, later, the ES/9370 CPF (Control Program Facility) for the System/38 IBM i, previously i5/OS and OS/400, successor to CPF for AS/400, IBM Power Systems, and PureSystems IBSYS (IBM 7090/94 operating system) IX/370 An IBM proprietary UNIX OS (Interactive eXecutive for IBM System/370) Model 44 Programming System for the System/360 Model 44 OS/360 (Operating System/360 for IBM System/360) PCP (Primary Control Program option) MFT (Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks option) MVT (Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks option) M65MP (Model 65 Multiprocessor option) OS/VS1 (Operating System—Virtual Storage 1) for IBM System/370, virtual memory successor to MFT OS/VS2 (Operating System—Virtual Storage 2) for IBM System/370, virtual memory successor to MVT SVS: Release 1 (Single Virtual Storage) MVS: Release 2–3.8 (Multiple Virtual address Spaces) MVS/370 (OS/VS2 2.0-3.8, MVS/SE, MVS/SP V1) MVS/SE: MVS System Extensions Release 1: based on OS/VS2 R3.7 plus selectable units Release 2: based on OS/VS2 R3.8 plus selectable units MVS/SP: MVS/System Product, replacement for MVS/SE MVS/SP V3 MVS/ESA SP V4 MVS/ESA SP V5 MVS/XA (Multiple Virtual Systems—Extended Architecture): MVS/SP V2 MVS/ESA (Multiple Virtual Systems—Enterprise Systems Architecture) OS/390, successor to MVS for IBM System/390 z/OS, successor to OS/390 for z/Architecture and, up through Version 1.5, System/390 OS/2 (Operating System/2) for the IBM PS/2 PC DOS (Personal Computer Disk Operating System) System Support Program for System/34, System/36 Transaction Processing Facility, formerly IBM Airline Control Program (ACP) TSS/360 (Time Sharing System, a failed predecessor to VM/CMS, intended for the IBM System/360 Model 67) CP-67 May refer to either a package for the 360/67 or only to the Control program of that package.
