SMP capability exists only on Xeon-based (socket 604) motherboards using the 875P chipset. FSB is rated at 533 MHz on these motherboards. 865PE (Springdale) 875P without PAT, though it was possible to enable PAT in some early revisions. Also lacks ECC Memory support. Sub-versions: 865P - Similar to 865PE, but supports only 400/533 MHz bus and 333 MHz memory. 848P - Single memory channel version of 865PE. 865G (Springdale-G) 865PE with integrated graphics (Intel Extreme Graphics 2). PAT never supported in any revisions. Sub-versions: 865GV - 865G without external AGP slot. E7221 (Copper River) Designed for Pentium 4-based server. Supports only one physical processor. A basic SVGA controller is integrated for analog video. One PCI-X slot can be bridged to the PCI-e ×8 using the Intel® 6702PXH 64-bit PCI Hub. E7230 (Mukilteo) Similar to the Intel 3000 MCH, but mainly designed for Pentium D-based server. Supports only one physical processor. DDR2-667 4-4-4 is not supported [32]. No integrated graphics. One PCI-X slot can be bridged to the PCI-e ×8 using Intel® 6700PXH 64-bit PCI Hub/Intel® 6702PXH 64-bit PCI Hub.

Summary: 915P (Grantsdale) Supports Pentium 4 on an 800 MT/s bus. Uses DDR memory up to 400 MHz, or DDR2 at 533 MHz. Replaces AGP and CSA with PCI Express, and also supports "Matrix RAID", a RAID mode designed to allow the usage of RAID levels 0 and 1 simultaneously with two hard drives. (Normally RAID1+0 would have required four hard drives) Sub-versions: 915PL - Cut-down version of 915P with no support for DDR2 and only supporting 2 GB of memory. 915G (Grantsdale-G) 915P with an integrated GMA 900. This core contains Pixel Shader version 2.0 only, it does not contain Vertex Shaders nor does it feature Transform & Lighting (T&L) capabilities and therefore is not Direct X 8.1 or 9.0 compliant. Sub-versions: 915GL - Same feature reductions as 915PL, but supports 4 GB of memory. No support for external graphics cards. 915GV - Same as 915G, but has no way of adding an external graphics card. 910GL - No support for external graphics cards or 800 MT/s bus. 925X (Alderwood) Higher end version of 915. Supports another PAT-like mode and ECC memory, and exclusively uses DDR-II RAM. Sub-versions: 925XE - Supports a 1066 MT/s bus. 945P (Lakeport) Update on 915P, with support for Serial ATA II, RAID mode 5, an improved memory controller with support for DDR-II at 667 MHz and additional PCI Express lanes. Support for DDR-I is dropped. Formal dual-core support was added to this chipset. Sub-versions: 945PL - No support for 1066 MT/s bus, only supports 2 GB of memory. 945G (Lakeport-G) A version of the 945P that has a GMA 950 integrated, supports a 1066 MT/s bus. Sub-versions: 945GC - Same feature reductions as 945PL but with an integrated GMA 950. 945GZ - Same as 945GC but only supports DDR2 memory at 400/533 MT/s. No support for external graphics cards (some boards, like Asus P5GZ-MX, support through ICH7 on PCIe ×16 @4 lanes mode). 955X (Lakeport) Update for 925X, with additional features of "Lakeport" (e.g., PAT features and ECC memory), and uses DDR2.

B43 - Q43 with an ICH10D South Bridge. [1] The 975X chipset supports only ×16 PCI Express (electrically) in the top slot when the slot below it is unpopulated. Otherwise it and the lower slot (both attached to the Memory Controller Hub) operate at ×8 electrically. [2] Officially 975X supports a maximum of 1066 MT/s FSB. Unofficially, third-party motherboards (Asus, Gigabyte) support certain 1333FSB 45 nm Core2 processors, usually with later BIOS updates. [3] The 975X chipset technical specification shows only DDR2-533/667 memory support. Actual implementations of 975X do support DDR2 800. [4] VT-d is inherently supported on these chipsets, but may not be enabled by individual OEMs. Always read the motherboard manual and check for BIOS updates. X38/X48 VT-d support is limited to certain Intel, Supermicro, DFI (LanParty) and Tyan boards. VT-d is broken or non existent on some boards until the BIOS is updated. Note that VT-d is a chipset Memory Controller Hub technology, not a processor feature, but this is complicated by later processor generations (Core i3/i5/i7) moving the MCH from the motherboard to the processor package, making only certain I series CPUs support VT-d.

For high-end Nehalem processors, the X58 IOH acts as a bridge from the QPI to PCI Express peripherals and DMI to the ICH10 southbridge. For mainstream and lower-end Nehalem processors, the integrated memory controller (IMC) is an entire northbridge (some even having GPUs), and the PCH (Platform Controller Hub) acts as a southbridge. Not listed below is the 3450 chipset (see Xeon chipsets) which is compatible with Nehalem mainstream and high-end processors but does not claim core iX-compatibility. With either a Core i5 or i3 processor, the 3400-series chipsets enable the ECC functionality of unbuffered ECC memory.[50] Otherwise these chipsets do not enable unbuffered ECC functionality. The Cougar Point Intel 6 series chipsets with stepping B2 were recalled due to a hardware bug that causes their 3 Gbit/s Serial ATA to degrade over time until they become unusable. Stepping B3 of the Intel 6 series chipsets will have the fix for this. The Z68 chipset which supports CPU overclocking and use of the integrated graphics does not have this hardware bug, however all other ones with B2 did.[51] The Z68 also added support for transparently caching hard disk data on to solid-state drives (up to 64 GB), a technology called Smart Response Technology.[52] LGA 1156[edit] Main article: Intel 5 Series Chipsets supporting LGA 1156 CPUs (Lynnfield and Clarkdale).

Because of this, the same chipset can be used for Socket 8, Socket 370, Slot 1, or Slot 2 designs with any CPU in the P6 family. In practice however, newer chipset designs are usually made only for the newer processor packages, and older ones may not be updated to accommodate for recent package designs. In addition, certain chipsets may be implemented in motherboards with different processor packages, much like how the 440FX could be used either with a Pentium Pro (Socket 8) or Pentium II (Slot 1). A new feature for the latest Intel chipsets is hardware virtualization support (Intel VT-d).[24] The chipset support for this technology is not very clear for the moment.[25] ^ The Intel 82943GML mobile chipset unofficially supports Core Duo, Core 2 Duo, and Pentium Dual Core processors as well as 667 MHz FSB, which is a popular upgrade for many older notebook computers such as certain models of Acer Aspire 3680. ^ a b c d e f g h i j k Aggregated speed for both directions References[edit] ^ Michael H.
