Lynx (web browser) - Wikipedia Lynx (web browser) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Text-based, cross-platform web browser Not to be confused with Links (web browser) or LynxOS. Lynx An older version of this article displayed in Lynx Original author(s) Lou Montulli, Michael Grobe, Charles Rezac Developer(s) Thomas Dickey [Wikidata] Initial release 1992; 28 years ago (1992) Stable release(s) [±] 2.8.9rel.1[1][2] (8 July 2018; 2 years ago (2018-07-08)) [±] Preview release(s) [±] 2.9.0dev.6 (5 September 2020; 2 months ago (2020-09-05)[3]) [±] Repository invisible-mirror.net/archives/lynx/ Written in ISO C Engine fork of libwww Operating system Unix-like,[4] DOS, Windows[5] Available in English Type Text-based web browser License GNU GPLv2 Website invisible-island.net/lynx/ Lynx is a customizable text-based web browser for use on cursor-addressable character cell terminals.[6][7] As of 2020[update], it is the oldest web browser still being maintained,[8] having started in 1992.

Foteos Macrides ported much of Lynx to VMS and maintained it for a time. In 1995, Lynx was released under the GNU General Public License, and is now maintained by a group of volunteers led by Thomas Dickey [Wikidata].[21] Features[edit] Lynx and Firefox rendering the same page Browsing in Lynx consists of highlighting the chosen link using cursor keys, or having all links on a page numbered and entering the chosen link's number.[22] Current versions support SSL[7] and many HTML features. Tables are formatted using spaces, while frames are identified by name and can be explored as if they were separate pages. Lynx is not inherently able to display various types of non-text content on the web, such as images and video,[6] but it can launch external programs to handle it, such as an image viewer or a video player.[22] Unlike most web browsers, Lynx does not support JavaScript or Adobe Flash,[23] which some websites require to work correctly. The speed benefits of text-only browsing are most apparent when using low bandwidth internet connections, or older computer hardware that may be slow to render image-heavy content. Privacy[edit] Because Lynx does not support graphics, web bugs that track user information are not fetched; therefore, web pages can be read without the privacy concerns of graphic web browsers.[10] However, Lynx does support HTTP cookies,[6] which can also be used to track user information. Lynx therefore supports cookie whitelisting and blacklisting, or alternatively cookie support can be disabled permanently.[22] As with conventional browsers, Lynx also supports browsing histories and page caching,[24] both of which can raise privacy concerns.[25] Configurability[edit] Lynx accepts configuration options from either command-line options or configuration files. There are 142 command line options according to its help message. The template configuration file lynx.cfg lists 233 configurable features. There is some overlap between the two, although there are command-line options such as -restrict which are not matched in lynx.cfg. In addition to pre-set options by command-line and configuration file, Lynx's behavior can be adjusted at runtime using its options menu. Again, there is some overlap between the settings. Lynx implements many of these runtime optional features, optionally (controlled through a setting in the configuration file) allowing the choices to be saved to a separate writable configuration file. The reason for restricting the options which can be saved originated in a usage of Lynx which was more common in the mid-1990s, i.e., using Lynx itself as a front-end application to the Internet accessed by dial-in connections.[26][27][22] Accessibility[edit] Because of its refreshable braille display and text-to-speech–friendly interface, Lynx can be used for internet access by visually impaired users.[28][11][17] As Lynx substitutes images, frames and other non-textual content with the text from alt, name and title HTML attributes[29] and allows hiding the user interface elements,[30] the browser becomes specifically suitable for use with cost-effective general purpose screen reading software.[31][32][33] A version of Lynx specifically enhanced for use with screen readers on Windows was developed at Indian Institute of Technology Madras.[34] Remote access[edit] Lynx is also useful for accessing websites from a remotely connected system in which no graphical display is available.[35][36][37] Despite its text-only nature and age, it can still be used to effectively browse much of the modern web, including performing interactive tasks such as editing Wikipedia.[24][38][39] Web design and robots[edit] Since Lynx will take keystrokes from a text file, it is still very useful for automated data entry, web page navigation, and web scraping. Consequently, Lynx is used in some web crawlers.[citation needed] Web designers may use Lynx to determine the way in which search engines and web crawlers see the sites that they develop.[40][41][42] Online services that provide Lynx's view of a given web page are available.[43] Lynx is also used to test websites' performance. As one can run the browser from different locations over remote access technologies like telnet and ssh, one can use Lynx to test the web site's connection performance from different geographical locations simultaneously.[38] Another possible web design application of the browser is quick checking of the site's links.[44] Supported platforms[edit] Icon for OS/2 port Lynx was originally designed for Unix-like operating systems, though it was ported to VMS soon after its public release[citation needed] and to other systems, including DOS, Microsoft Windows, Classic Mac OS and OS/2.[9] It was included in the default OpenBSD installation from OpenBSD 2.3 (May 1998)[45] to 5.5 (May 2014),[46] being in the main tree prior to July 2014,[47] subsequently being made available through the ports tree,[48] and can also be found in the repositories of most Linux distributions, as well as in the Homebrew[49] and Fink repositories for macOS.[39] Ports to BeOS, MINIX, QNX, AmigaOS[50] and OS/2[10] are also available. The sources can be built on many platforms, e.g., mention is made of Google's Android operating system.[51] See also[edit] Free and open-source software portal Computer accessibility Links (web browser) ELinks w3m ModSecurity#Former Lynx browser blocking Comparison of web browsers Timeline of web browsers Comparison of Usenet newsreaders Notes[edit] ^ Dickey, Thomas E.
