It has been superseded by DSS1 but is still in use on some lines and private exchanges. 1 TR 6 did not support multiple subscriber numbers but featured an Endgeräteauswahlziffer (EAZ, German "user device selection digit"). ISDN subscribers would get a sequence of 10 subsequent subscriber numbers, the last digit of which being the EAZ. The EAZ "0" was used for "global calls" to all connected devices. 1 TR 6 also offered semipermanent connections, which were (comparatively cheap) leased lines that could be temporarily disabled to use the B channel for other purposes. It is said that the "TR" simply stands for "technische Richtlinie" (technical guidelines).
