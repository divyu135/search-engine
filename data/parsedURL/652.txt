The built-in where command. Works like the which command but shows all locations of the target command in the directories specified in $PATH rather than only the one that will be used. Named directories. This allows the user to set up shortcuts such as ~mydir, which then behave the way ~ and ~user do. Oh My Zsh[edit] This section relies too much on references to primary sources.
