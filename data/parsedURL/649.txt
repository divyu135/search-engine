Munro First appeared 1996; 24 years ago (1996) Stable release 2.2.04 / May 2015; 5 years ago (2015-05) OS Unix-like systems including macOS, Microsoft Windows License BSD Filename extensions .i Website yorick.github.com Yorick is an interpreted programming language designed for numerics, graph plotting, and steering large scientific simulation codes. It is quite fast due to array syntax, and extensible via C or Fortran routines. It was created in 1996 by David H. Munro of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Features[edit] Indexing[edit] Yorick is good at manipulating elements in N-dimensional arrays conveniently with its powerful syntax. Several elements can be accessed all at once: > x=[1,2,3,4,5,6];> x[1,2,3,4,5,6]> x(3:6)[3,4,5,6]> x(3:6:2)[3,5]> x(6:3:-2)[6,4] Arbitrary elements > x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]> x[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]> x([2,1],[1,2])[[2,1],[5,4]]> list=where(1<x)> list[2,3,4,5,6]> y=x(list)> y[2,3,4,5,6] Pseudo-index Like "theading" in PDL and "broadcasting" in Numpy, Yorick has a mechanism to do this: > x=[1,2,3]> x[1,2,3]> y=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]> y[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]> y(-,)[[[1],[2],[3]],[[4],[5],[6]]]> x(-,)[[1],[2],[3]]> x(,-)[[1,2,3]]> x(,-)/y[[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]> y=[[1.,2,3],[4,5,6]]> x(,-)/y[[1,1,1],[0.25,0.4,0.5]] Rubber index ".." is a rubber-index to represent zero or more dimensions of the array. > x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]> x[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]> x(..,1)[1,2,3]> x(1,..)[1,4]> x(2,..,2)5 "*" is a kind of rubber-index to reshape a slice(sub-array) of array to a vector. > x(*)[1,2,3,4,5,6] Tensor multiplication Tensor multiplication is done as follows in Yorick: P(,+, )*Q(, +) means ∑ j = 1 j = N P i j k l Q m n j {\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{j=N}{P_{ijkl}Q_{mnj}}} > x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]> x[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]> y=[[7,8],[9,10],[11,12]]> x(,+)*y(+,)[[39,54,69],[49,68,87],[59,82,105]]> x(+,)*y(,+)[[58,139],[64,154]] External links[edit] Official website Linux Journal Review Yorick Language Quick Reference Guide Yorick manual Yorick tutorial on JehTech v t e Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Facilities Mirror Fusion Test Facility Tandem Mirror Experiment National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center National Ignition Facility Supercomputers ASC Purple ASCI Blue Pacific ASCI White Peloton Sierra Products Lasers Argus Cyclops Janus Long path Nova Novette Shiva Others Gist LLNL RISE process LX-14 Micropower impulse radar Reliable Replacement Warhead ROSE SCALD Silo Slapper detonator W47 W70 W71 Yorick People Ernest Lawrence Edward Teller Related IBM Blue Gene Inertial confinement fusion Laser Inertial Fusion Energy Stockpile stewardship Sustained Spheromak Physics Experiment Z-Division Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yorick_(programming_language)&oldid=956148263" Categories: Array programming languages Free compilers and interpreters Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Programming languages created in 1996 Hidden categories: Articles with topics of unclear notability from July 2011 All articles with topics of unclear notability Articles lacking in-text citations from January 2018 All articles lacking in-text citations Articles with multiple maintenance issues Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Article Talk Variants Views Read Edit View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Current events Random article About Wikipedia Contact us Donate Contribute Help Learn to edit Community portal Recent changes Upload file Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Cite this page Wikidata item Print/export Download as PDF Printable version Languages العربية Français עברית Bahasa Melayu Português Suomi Edit links This page was last edited on 11 May 2020, at 19:04 (UTC).
