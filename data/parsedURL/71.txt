88open - Wikipedia 88open From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search The 88open Consortium Ltd. was an industry standards group set up by Motorola in 1988 to standardize Unix systems on their Motorola 88000 RISC processor systems.[1] At its peak, it had a staff of 30 people and over 50 supporters.[2] The effort was largely a failure, at least in terms of attracting attention to the 88000 platform, and the group folded as soon as Motorola turned their attention to the PowerPC.[3][4] Contents 1 Members 2 Standards 3 See also 4 References Members[edit] Motorola provided 50% of the financial support for the consortium. Early members were Data General, Convergent and Tektronics. By May 1988, there were 28 companies who had joined with 7 not releasing their names.[5][6] Standards[edit] Object Compatibility Standard (OCS): An 88open standard for compilers and linkers.
