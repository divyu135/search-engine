Interactive computation - Wikipedia Interactive computation From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Not to be confused with Interactive computing. In computer science, interactive computation is a mathematical model for computation that involves input/output communication with the external world during computation. This is in contrast to the traditional understanding of computation which assumes reading input only before computation and writing output only after computation, thus defining a kind of "closed" computation. The Church-Turing thesis attempts to define computation and computability in terms of Turing machines. Because the Turing machine model only provides an answer to the question of what computability of functions means, but interactive tasks are not always reducible to functions,[clarification needed] it fails to capture a broader intuition of computation and computability. It was not until recently[when?] that the theoretical computer science community realized the necessity to define adequate mathematical models of interactive computation.

Goldin's Persistent Turing Machines (PTMs), and Yuri Gurevich's abstract state machines. Peter Wegner has additionally done a great deal of work on this area of computer science[citation needed].
