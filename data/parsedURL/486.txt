Prefix grammar - Wikipedia Prefix grammar From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a prefix grammar is a type of string rewriting system, consisting of a set of string rewriting rules, and similar to a formal grammar or a semi-Thue system. What is specific about prefix grammars is not the shape of their rules, but the way in which they are applied: only prefixes are rewritten. The prefix grammars describe exactly all regular languages.[1] Contents 1 Formal definition 2 Example 3 See also 4 References Formal definition[edit] A prefix grammar G is a 3-tuple, (Σ, S, P), where Σ is a finite alphabet S is a finite set of base strings over Σ P is a finite set of production rules of the form u → v where u and v are strings over Σ For strings x, y, we write x →G y (and say: G can derive y from x in one step) if there are strings u, v, w such that x = v u , y = w u {\displaystyle x=vu,y=wu} , and v → w is in P. Note that →G is a binary relation on the strings of Σ. The language of G, denoted L ( G ) {\displaystyle L(G)} , is the set of strings derivable from S in zero or more steps: formally, the set of strings w such that for some s in S, s R w, where R is the transitive closure of →G. Example[edit] The prefix grammar Σ = {0, 1} S = {01, 10} P = {0 → 010, 10 → 100} describes the language defined by the regular expression 01 ( 01 ) ∗ ∪ 100 ∗ {\displaystyle 01(01)^{*}\cup 100^{*}} See also[edit] Regular grammar References[edit] ^ M.
