Western Design Center Type Privately held company Industry Electronics Founded 1978; 42 years ago (1978) in Mesa, Arizona, United States Founder Bill Mensch Headquarters Mesa , United States Area served Worldwide Key people Bill Mensch Products Microprocessors, microcontrollers, support devices Owner Bill Mensch Website www.westerndesigncenter.com The Western Design Center (WDC), located in Mesa, Arizona, United States, is a company which develops intellectual property for, and licenses manufacture of, MOS Technology 65xx based microprocessors, microcontrollers (µCs), and related support devices. WDC was founded in 1978 by a former MOS Technology employee and coholder of the MOS Technology 6502 patent, Bill Mensch. Beyond discrete devices, WDC offers device designs in the form of semiconductor intellectual property cores (IP cores) to use inside other chips such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs), and provides ASIC and embedded systems consulting services revolving around their processor designs. WDC also produces C compilers, assembler/linker packages, simulators, development–evaluation printed circuit boards, and in-circuit emulators for their processors.
