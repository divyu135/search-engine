iBook - Wikipedia iBook From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Series of laptops by Apple Computer Not to be confused with the Apple Books book reader application for iOS and macOS, formerly called iBooks. A 12" iBook G3 iBook Developer Apple Computer, Inc. Product family Macintosh Type Laptop Release date July 21, 1999 (1999-07-21) Discontinued May 16, 2006 Operating system Classic Mac OS Mac OS X CPU PowerPC G3 PowerPC G4 @ 300 MHz - 1.42 GHz Display TFT LCD Successor MacBook (2006–2012) Related articles PowerBook iMac iBook is a line of laptop computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1999 to 2006. The line targeted entry-level, consumer and education markets, with lower specifications and prices than the PowerBook, Apple's higher-end line of laptop computers. It was the first mass consumer product to offer Wi-Fi network connectivity, which was then branded by Apple as AirPort.[1][2] The iBook had three different designs during its lifetime. The first, known as the "Clamshell", was inspired by the design of Apple's popular iMac line at the time. It was a significant departure from previous portable computer designs due to its shape, bright colors, incorporation of a handle into the casing, lack of a display closing latch, lack of a hinged cover over the external ports and built-in wireless networking. Two years later, the second generation abandoned the original form factor in favor of a more conventional, rectangular design. In October 2003, the third generation was introduced, adding a PowerPC G4 chip, USB 2.0 and a slot-loading drive. They were very popular in education, with Henrico County Public Schools being the first of many school systems in the United States to distribute one to every student. Apple replaced the iBook line with the MacBook in May 2006 during the Mac transition to Intel processors.

Type Laptop Release date July 21, 1999 Introductory price US$1,599 (equivalent to $2,454 in 2019) Discontinued May 1, 2001 CPU PowerPC G3, 300–466 MHz Successor iBook G3 (Snow) In the late 1990s, Apple was trimming its product line from the bewildering variety of intersecting Performa, Quadra, LC, Power Macintosh and PowerBook models to a simplified "four box" strategy: desktop and portable computers, each in both consumer and professional models. Three boxes of this strategy were already in place: The newly introduced iMac was the consumer desktop, the Blue and White G3 filled the professional desktop box, and the PowerBook line served as the professional portable line. This left only the consumer portable space empty, leading to much rumor on the Internet of potential designs and features. Putting an end to this speculation, on July 21, 1999, Steve Jobs unveiled the iBook G3 during the keynote presentation of Macworld Conference & Expo, New York City. Like the iMac, the iBook G3 had a PowerPC G3 CPU, and no legacy Apple interfaces. USB, Ethernet, modem ports and an optical drive were standard. The ports were left uncovered along the left side, as a cover was thought to be fragile and unnecessary with the iBook's new interfaces, which lacked the exposed pins of earlier connectors. When the lid was closed, the hinge kept it firmly shut, so there was no need for a latch on the screen. The hinge included an integrated carrying handle. Additional power connectors on the bottom surface allowed multiple iBook G3s to be charged on a custom-made rack. The iBook G3 was the first Mac to use Apple's new "Unified Logic Board Architecture", which condensed all of the machine's core features into two chips, and added AGP and Ultra DMA support. The iBook was the first mainstream computer designed and sold with integrated wireless networking.[3] On the iBook's introduction, Phil Schiller, Apple's VP of Marketing, held an iBook while jumping off a height as data from the computer was transferred to another in order to demonstrate the wireless networking capability. The display bezel contained the wireless antenna, which attached to an optional internal wireless card. Lucent helped create this wireless capability which established the industry standard. Apple released the AirPort Wireless Base Station at the same time. There was heated debate over many things such as the aesthetics, features, weight, performance and pricing.[4][5] To provide sufficient impact protection, the iBook was larger and heftier than the PowerBook of the time, and yet had lower specifications. Standard features like PC card slots were absent, and so were speculated features such as touch screens and an ultra-long battery life. The iBook gained the label "Barbie's toilet seat", due to the distinctive design.[6] Nevertheless, this same design made the iBook G3 unmistakable in movies and television shows. The iBook was a commercial success.[7] The line continually received processor, memory, hard disk upgrades and new colors. FireWire and video out were later added. The design was discontinued in May 2001, in favor of the new "Dual USB" iBooks. Design[edit] iBook G3 ("Clamshell") in all five colors: "Tangerine" and "Blueberry" on the top row, and "Graphite", "Indigo" and "Key Lime" on the bottom row. Key Lime was an Apple Online Store exclusive. The design was clearly influenced by Apple's consumer desktop, the iMac. In fact, one of the marketing slogans for the iBook was "iMac to go." The clamshell design also echoed the eMate 300. Apple continued its trend of using transparent colored plastics for the shell, and released the iBook clamshell series in several colors, starting with Blueberry and Tangerine, later adding Indigo, Graphite and Key Lime colors. However, unlike the iMac, the iBook did not feature pinstripes. Steve Jobs announced that the Key Lime color, "a little less conservative, a little more fun", was exclusive to the online Apple Store. This resulted in some crowd members booing, to which Jobs replied: "Don't you like buying on the Apple Online Store?"[8] Compared to follow-up iBook and PowerBook notebook computers, the Clamshell iBook proved to be the more reliable model.[9] The original iBook is on exhibition at the London Design Museum and the Yale University Art Gallery.[10][11] Vestiges of design ideas first adopted in the iBook G3 can still be seen today: moving interface ports from the back to the sides and leaving them uncovered, omitting a latch for the computer's lid, and providing multiple color options.

No other modifications were possible in-warranty. There was no PCMCIA port for additional expansion capabilities. 40 screws needed to be removed to access the hard drive. The optical drive, however, can be accessed far more easily, requiring only 11 screws and one standoff to be removed. Later on, some users transplanted a 1024×768 LCD from the more recent white iBook into a clamshell iBook. This is only possible with the "FireWire" and "FireWire SE" models, as they have 8 MB of video RAM; the older ones only have 4 MB.[13] All clamshell iBooks shipped with Mac OS 8.6 or 9.0. All clamshell iBooks supported Mac OS X 10.0 through 10.3.9. Mac OS X v10.4 "Tiger" can also be installed. iBook G3 Dual USB ("Snow")[edit] iBook G3 Snow The second-generation iBook G3 "Snow" (12.1 in). Developer Apple Computer, Inc. Type Laptop Release date May 1, 2001 Discontinued October 22, 2003 CPU PowerPC G3, 500–900 MHz Predecessor iBook G3 Clamshell Successor IBook G4 Apple debuted the next-generation iBook G3 at a press conference in Cupertino, California, on May 1, 2001. The previous bold colors and bulky form-factor were abandoned, as were the handle, latch-less design and additional power connectors on the bottom surface. The resulting iBook was available in white only, hence the name "Snow" and incorporated transparent polycarbonate in its casing. It was 30% lighter, and occupied less than half of the volume of the model it replaced, being smaller in all three dimensions. Despite that, it added an extra USB port and a higher resolution screen. Apple claimed the compact design did not sacrifice durability, saying it was "Twice as durable" as the previous model. With this revision, Apple began transitioning to translucent and white polycarbonate casings in most of its consumer line, such as the iMac and the eMac. In contrast, most of its professional products used an anodized aluminum finish. Near the end of its run, the Snow iBook G3 case became opaque and white instead of translucent white and magnesium.

This gives the keyboard a "spongy" effect, especially in PowerPC G3 models with the translucent keyboard. The "sponginess" was corrected in the PowerPC G4 models. Accessing the hard disk drive is complex and time-consuming, involving partial disassembly of the unit and the removal of over 30 different-sized screws. The memory in the iBook G4 is covered by a removable Airport card, and accessible by removing the RAM shield with a Phillips#00 screwdriver. While some of the earlier models (e.g., 800 MHz and 933 MHz) have a specified 640 MB RAM limit, it is possible to have a total of 1.12 GB of RAM installed (128 MB built-in, plus a 1 GB SO-DIMM), or 1.25 or 1.5 GB in the later models with 256 or 512 MB of RAM soldered to the logic board. Although no longer officially supported by macOS versions beyond those given in the chart above, the system has also been supported via MorphOS (an Amiga compatible OS) since version 3.2. Notes[edit] A copy of Marble Blast Gold came preinstalled on a certain version of the iBook G4 as a promotion of the game. Quality issues[edit] Apple initiated the "iBook Logic Board Repair Extension Program" in January 2004, which covered the expense of repairing display problems of iBook G3 models for three years.[14] In June 2004, the Repair Extension Program was expanded to cover all White G3 iBooks.[15][16] The iBook G4 allegedly suffered from display problems similar to those of the iBook G3, but was not covered by the repair extension program. Owners of iBooks that required expensive repairs for these problems submitted new class action lawsuits in December 2006.[citation needed] On May 2, 2007, the Danish Consumer Board published an extensive 3rd party report[17][18] concerning the Apple iBook G4 logic board issue. A press release[19] referred to the global consequences that this could have for possible guarantee claims.
